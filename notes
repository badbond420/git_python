Q: what happens to commits, when merged to master, how are the sequence in multi developer environments?
Ans: it merges all commits and looks as, those commits happened in single branch
Q: what is origin
Ans: Origin is the alias for the remote repo

- everytime git add (staging), then commit
- git diff shows the code changes in same
- head points to current active branch
- during mrg also, have to pass a commit.
- git revert(only prev commit) wir take the state to that commit, and do a new comit to save the back date data.
- git reset file (oposite of add)/  or we can use git checkout again to claer changes.
- hit reset(hard)    os like revert but, it just moves back to pointer to back commit, and forgets newer commits after that point
- git checkout also checkout one commit id in same barnch
- git fetch --all will get all the remote branches to local machine
- if you are using ssh to authenticate, then clone the ssh url not http url, http url asks for user/pass for push.
Q: mrg conflict
- if branch is ahaed of master, then mrg conflict wont happen, though u edited same line/file in branch.
- or if the same file not edited in dif branched with ref to a last commit, where branch created.
- mrg conflict ocuures if same file is edited in diff branch + both brach re ahaed of the commit from where
  branch is created.
- resolve mrg by pycharm ui.
- change latest commit msg by "commit --amend -m"

Q: pull vs fetch, what happend if file changed and done pull on top of it
- git pull, fetch and mrg but fetch only fetch, to merge, you have to
  do git merge origin/master
- during pull, if mismatch , then resolve MRG CONFLICT
Q: push all branches ata a time
- git push REMOTE --all
Q: rebase
- it more of re writing history, if u have forked a brench from before, but now you want to change the fork point to a latest
  commit, you have to do it using re-base
- tag is used to give a name to a commit rather than ugly hash, mostly tag is used to pin a important invo, may be version1.0. so that
  we dont have to remember the ugly hash.
- tag can be used as alternative name o of a commit id.
  
Q. Reset  master (local/remote) branch to previous commit
git reset (--hard) cedc856 :without hard the changed files shows as edited in red.
git push --force origin master
Q. above with revert
it does only to previous commit

Q. Undo local changes ( + with reset) 
git reset --hard HEAD # all
git checkout <file>

Q. Un-stage local changes 
git reset #for all files
git reset <filename>

-what happens to commits, when merged to master, how are the sequence in multi developer environments?
Ans: it merges all commits and looks as, those commits happened in single branch
- what is origin
Ans: Origin is the alias for the remote repo
- git reset file (oposite of add)
- everytime git add (staging), then commit
- git diff shows the code changes in same
- head points to current active branch
- during mrg also, have to pass a commit.

? mrg conflict
? pull vs fetch, what happend if file changed and done pull on top of it
? push all branches ata a time
? rebase

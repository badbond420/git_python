Q: what happens to commits, when merged to master, how are the sequence in multi developer environments?
Ans: it merges all commits and looks as, those commits happened in single branch
Q: what is origin
Ans: Origin is the alias for the remote repo
- git reset file (oposite of add)
- everytime git add (staging), then commit
- git diff shows the code changes in same
- head points to current active branch
- during mrg also, have to pass a commit.

Q: mrg conflict
- if branch is ahaed of master, then mrg conflict wont happen, though u edited same line/file in branch.
- or if the same file not edited in dif branched with ref to a last commit, where branch created.
- mrg conflict ocuures if same file is edited in diff branch + both brach re ahaed of the commit from where
  branch is created.
- resolve mrg by pycharm ui.
- change latest commit msg by "commit --amend -m"
? pull vs fetch, what happend if file changed and done pull on top of it
? push all branches ata a time
? rebase
